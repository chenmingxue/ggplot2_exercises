# Introduction
On Jan 6th, 2018, I was sitting in a Starbucks and working through exercises in Hadley Wickham's Ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis. I quickly found there are 
no solutions in the back of the book or the web. As an eager student of ggplot2 and R, I was surprised and felt depleted. How would I be able to
learn from these excellent exercises by Hadley if there are no answers to them. Were my answers right? Were they wrong? Were they even on the 
right track? 

Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not directing my opinion towards the author of the book, Hadley Wickham. He is an excellent educator
and author of many books (R for Data Science, Advanced R), from which I have benefited greatly. Rather I am surprised at the R community as a whole. 
Surely, somebody in this world must have written up something? As a matter of fact, I do spot several incomplete solution sets like these:
https://github.com/M-E-Steiner/ggplot2-book-solutions. However, I wanted the complete version! 

As a result, I took to Twitter, asking if anybody out there was interested in forming a virtual study group and crafting a complete solution set to the ggplot2 book (https://twitter.com/jasonbaik94/status/949731332405583872)
All thanks to Hadley Wickham's retweet, this tweet generated alot of interest from the rstats community on Twitter. Thank you Hadley!

Well, here is my solution set for the future generation of ggplot2 students!
